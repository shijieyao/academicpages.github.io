  As usual I went to Dai Pai, a HK street food style restaurant near the campus for lunch.

  As usual I ordred Sriracha beef with rice.

  But not as usual, this time I obviously got less rice than usual.

  How did I come with up such concept of 'usual' or 'unusual'?

  There's probably a dynamic process in my brain, constantly computing the mean and variance of how much beef and rice I was given every time.

  Whenever it's too obvious an outlier, my brain would get ignited.
