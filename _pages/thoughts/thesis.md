Desperate. Wanna go home.

Keep writing nonsense in Japanese on white paper.

Repeating Sara Kurokawa's _My life_.

意味のないでき事、世の中一つもない。

何かを否定するためにやったことも意味がある。

Wasting time...

<h3>13/May/2018</h3>

Unless you start to do something in practice, you would never know how many problems/questions you actually have and have to face...

Today I've come up with some questions like:

- Do input and outoput need to be of the same type of sub-word units?

- Regarding the vocabulary/lexicon, does that refer to all words (or any sub-word units) in input and output altogether?

- For BPE, do we apply BPE to both input and output?

Although some of them seem to have quite explicit and certain answers after I thought through for a while, the process of raising questions and figuring them out is a really important part of doing research.
